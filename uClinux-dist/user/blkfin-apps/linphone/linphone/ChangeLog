Monday Aug 26 2002: linphone-0.9.0
	- the sdp rtpmap string for alaw and mulaw codec was incorrect.

Sunday Aug 4 2002:	linphone-0.9.0pre3
	Non visible changes:
	- Linphone's internal audio architecture is ported to the new mediastreamer architecture.
	  The mediastreamer library is already present in linphone since October 29 2001 but
	  was never used at this time by the core program. Now lots of work has be done inside the
	  mediastreamer so that it is ready to be used by the core program. As a consequence, the
	  old architecture defined by the audio/ directory and the codec.c io.c files is dropped.
	  The mediastreamer architecture provides a modular framework for audio and video 
	  processing. It includes various audio and video codecs (or wrappers to third party 
	  audio and video codecs).
	Visible changes:
	- The Speex codec (http://speex.sourceforge.net) is now availlable to linphone, since it has
	  its mediastreamer wrapper. This patent-free codec provides two bitrates, the lowest 
	  being able to work with 56k dialup connections. This is a very important step, because
	  from now only the low quality LPC10 codec was availlable for such connections.
	- Thanks to Florian Winsterstein (f-win at gmx.de), a console version of linphone called
	  "linphonec" is availlable. Linphonec can be compiled without gnome.

Wednesday May 8 2002:	linphone-0.8.0
	Visible changes:
	- Updated to libosip-0.8.5, that reflects the lastest sip draft.
	- Uses the SDP parser the libosip, and uses also a modified version of its SDP negociator.
	  The MediaDesc object is removed, now osipua users have to deal with BodyHandler's, as the
	  SdpHandler that deals with sdp message generation and negociation.
	  The SDP parser and negociator can use the a=rtpmap fields, so that compliance is improved.
	- LPC10-1.5 codec has been assigned payload type 115 instead of 4 previously. This breaks
	  compatibility with older versions of linphone.
	- oRTP (the new RTP library) is used in place of the old lprtplib.
	- fix endianess problems in the audio part.
	Non visible changes (changes on libraries not currently used by linphone but used later):
	- mediastreamer has new working objects: webcam image capture, mpeg encoding and decoding
	  thanks to the libavcodec (ffmpeg) library, rtp wrapper thanks to oRTP.
