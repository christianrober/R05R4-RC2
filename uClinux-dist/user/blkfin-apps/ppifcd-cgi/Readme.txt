PPIFCD-CGI Frame Capture Driver test application  
by Michael Hennerich

The test application defaults to a Micron MT9M001 1.3 Megapixel CMOS digital imagine sensor. 
(1280 x 1024 pixels). In case you want to use this application with an different sensor, 
you have to do some slight modifications to the source code in fcd.c.
                                                                                                                                                            
In order to successfully build and run the PPIFCD-CGI Application, following                                
kernel and user space adjustments needs to be done.

2) Recompile kernel and user space


3) STAMP board hardware modifications.

	-Populate R85 and R86 with 10k Resistors
	-Cut connection trace SCK-PF3 between pads of R67
	-Populate R65 with Zero Ohm Resistor or bridge 

Wire a camera module as shown in schematic_ppi_cmos_camera.pdf to the PPI.

4) Starting the test Application:

From the shell:

    1.)	Configure Ethernet       : #ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1
    2.)	Starting the Application : #fcd &

4) Accessing the Web User Interface:

Open a web browser (Mozilla Firefox, IE)
Enter in the URL window: http://192.168.0.1
