The Network Scope, demonstrates a simple mechanism to share access and data distributed over    
a TCP/IP network. A web browser contacts the HTTP server running on Blackfin where the CGI      
program resides, and asks it to run the program. Parameters from the HTML form are passed to    
the program (parameters are passed through the Environment, or passed similar to command        
line arguments)The called program samples data from the ADC using a linux device driver         
(adsp-spiadc.c). Incoming samples are preprocessed and stored in a file. The CGI program then   
calls Gnuplot and requests to generate a PNG or JPEG image based on the sampled data and form   
settings. (Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven interactive datafile and function plotting 
utility). The server takes the output of the CGI program and returns it to the web browser.     
The web browser displays the output as an HTML page.                                           
                                                                                                
In order to successfully build and run the Application following                                
kernel and user space adjustments needs to be done.
