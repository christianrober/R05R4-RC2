 ****************************************************************************


Master Slave SPI mode test application:

Note: This application may not work on BF533 STAMP,
      since SPISS (PF0) is used and routed to the CPLD.

Master Slave Connection Matrix:

    Master  <-->    Slave:

    SPISEL2 --> SPISS
    SPI_CLK --> SPI_CLK
    MOSI    --> MOSI
    MISO    <-- MISO

Test application usage:

    spi_test [-h?vsc] [-c count] message string
            -h?            this help
            -v             print version info
            -s             slave mode operation
            -c count       slave mode operation receive count

Example:

Master:

    root:~> spi_test 'Test 123'
    Set slave receive count to 8 bytes
    Last TX msg: Test 123
    root:~>

Slave :

    root:~> spi_test -s -c 8
    Waiting to receive 8 bytes from SPI Master
    Last RX msg: Test 123
    root:~>
