                       Music Player Daemon (MPD) - UPGRADING

Upgrading to 0.11.0
-------------------

The database format has changed a little bit, but in a backward compatible way.
This means that if you upgrade to 0.11.0 from 0.10.x, you do not need to make
any changes.  However, if you downgrade back to 0.10.x, then you will need
to recreate your db.

The default port for MPD is now 6600, so update your mpd and client
configurations appropriatly.

Upgrading to 0.10.0
-------------------

All information is now stored in the db in UTF-8 format, and the character
set used for the filesystem is stored in the db.  Thus, it is highly
recommended that you recreate the db.  To do so, run mpd with the 
"--create-db" command line option.  Also, note that the filesystem
character set will be determined from your current locale settings.
If your locale settings are not the same as those used for the filesystem,
then use the config file parameter "filesystem_charset" to specify the
correct character set (this maybe neccessary if you create the db with root).

Upgrading to 0.9.3
------------------

Wave support was added, so to have your wave files added, update the db (mpc
update).  

Also, song lengths are now stored in the db.  To get this stuff
added to the db, you will need to recreate the db from scratch.  To do this,
run mpd with the "--create-db" commandline option. 

Upgrading to 0.9.0
------------------

The "stop_on_error" config parameter was removed, so be sure to remove this
parameter from your config file.

Upgrading to 0.8.x
------------------

If you have FLACs, then to have them added to your list of available music,
just use "update".

Upgrading from 0.5.x to 0.6.x
-----------------------------
If you have not compiled MPD with "make ogg", then nothing is needed.

If you compiled with "make ogg", just use "update" (available via the phpMp
interface) to add your OGGs to MPD's list of available music.
