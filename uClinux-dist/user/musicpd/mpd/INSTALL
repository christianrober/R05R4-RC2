$ ./configure

4) Compile

$ make

Install (Optional)

$ make install

Run
---

1) run mpd:
<port>: port number daemon listens on (if running as a user, this should be 
	greater than 1024)
<mp3 directory>:  directory containing mp3's
<playlist directory>: directory where playlists will be stored (and .mpddb will
	be placed)
<mpd log>: log file for mpd
<mpd err>: error log file for mpd

$ mpd <port> <mp3 directory> <playlist directory> <mpd log> <mpd err>

example where mpd executable is in mpd-x.x.x directory:
$ mpd-x.x.x/mpd 6600 mp3 playlists mpd.log mpd.err

Note: The first time you run mpd, it will "explore" your mp3 directory for
mp3's.

Also, mpd can alternatively use config file.  In this case,
run mpd like this:

$ mpd <config file>

(if no config file is specified, mpd's looks for ~/.mpdconf then /etc/mpd.conf)

an example would be:

$ mpd playlists/.mpdconf

A sample config file is included with the source of MPD, mpdconf.example .
