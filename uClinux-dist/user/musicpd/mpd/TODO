--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
